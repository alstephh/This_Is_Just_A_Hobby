DIRECTORY BUSTING 

1] /index.php       ---> run php 
2] /crossdomain.xml
3] /navigate        ---> navigate CMS

(note : I've lways used just dirb for directory busting but wasn't enough for this machine so using different type of DB tool can give different output)




EXPLOIT ---> use multi/http/navigate_cms_rce for RCE [setting VHOST]
