Gaining acces thanks to the exploit.py let-s try to find something usefull for gain some better access


1) in the 1.png we can see the authorized_keys file 
	|
	|
	V
we can notice the `from="*.infra.dyna.htb"` ---> we can connect if we satisfy this condition with SSH

so we need 2 things for gain access (to bindmgr) :
1) Find the rsa private key ----> found on 2.png and saved on pvt_key ----> adjust removing the special char
2) Satisfy the "from" condition

	What is PTR Record?
Is the opposite of the type "A" record ---> resolves an IP address to a fully qualifed domain name

			   IP_ADDRESS ----> DOMAIN NAME
		|
		|
		V
Usefull for inverse DNS (which is what we need for the condition "from")
|----> cat the infra.key file (/etc/bind/infra.key) for the infra-key
|----> use nsupdate for load the key file
|----> update add oops.infra.dyna.htb 86400 A <YOUR IP>
|----> update add <YOUR IP IN REVERSE>.in-addr.arpa 86400 PTR oops.infra.dyna.htb
|----> ssh -i [rsa pvt key] bindmgr@dyna.htb

		|

		V
with this we gain access as user 
(look priv_esc.txt)
