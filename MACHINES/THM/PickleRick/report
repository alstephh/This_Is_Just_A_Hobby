PICKLE RICK 	TRYHACKME

=======================================================================================================================================
OMG this type of crossover or whatever it is is cool, we need to find 3 ingredients to let rick return human, is a pickle now let's help him!
==========================================================================================================================================


Ok so what we have is just a webapp with a homepage and nothing to more to interract with.

So I'm gonna run some scan on the IP and directory busting for start...RICK I'M COMING


===PORTS=============================================
22	SSH
80	Apache 2.4.18



===DIRECTORY=BUSTING==================================
/assets 
just a directory where content of the web page are taken (saw it on burp) inside I can see some GIF and imags that are not used in
the homepage so as a hint I can tell that there is more other than webapge.

/robots.txt

/server-status
CODE 403



===ENUMERATION=========================================

Is a supernormal machine so I think now I need to focus on the webapp, while the directory busting is doing is job im gonna analyze
with burp (or how rick will say it *BBBUUUURRRRRPPPPP*, maybe is a hint?)
Actually nothing special inside the request so nop no hint (but cool word-play!).

Reviewing the code of the webpage we got a comment with a username "R1ckRul3s" so good thing we can try to ssh bruteforce with this username
but when I try to is telling me that ssh doesn't support password auth.
So I tried to login with the username I scraped but nothing give me "permission denied (publickey)"

Btw tried to see if /robots.txt exist and we got this string "Wubbalubbadubdub"
Idk if will be usefull or not but for be secure will note that


Tried with subdomains and vhost but noting, also no form or login so no injection to try what a pain

NIKTO output find a /login.php page, that's a good news, when we send the username and pasword we send a hrequest
with field username and password and a PHPSESSID is given to us, interesting

Using the username and the possible passwords found in /robots.txt we have access to the login page.

We have access to a dashboard with 4 (wll 5 actually) sections "Commands, Potions, Creatures, Potions, Beth Clone Notes", just 
Commands is able to be used as now cuz the others are bloccked with a message telling us only the real rick can access to it
(we need PE for that).


In "Commands" I'm able to run commands like ls,whoami and pwd but not cat, so let's try with a reverse shell.
Reverse shell somehow wasn't working maybe is blocked where the only opportunity for solve this box is using the webapp.

Using ls we see that a txt called Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt so using less or http://[VICTIM_IP]/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
we obtained the first ingredient Rick need is mr. meseek hair. [1/3]


There was another txt file called "clue.txt" telling us the hint to look around the file system for the other ingredients, let's do it.

Using the repeater I looked at the response and there was a string in a comment, this string is :

	Vm1wR1UxTnRWa2RUV0d4VFlrZFNjRlV3V2t0alJsWnlWbXQwVkUxV1duaFZNakExVkcxS1NHVkliRmhoTVhCb1ZsWmFWMVpWTVVWaGVqQT0==

Need to figure out how is encoded and what contains, in my little experience I can tell that if a encoded string ends with "==" is possible
that base64 is the encoder.

It returned the string "VjFSSmVGSXlSbGRpU0ZKcFVrVktTMVZxU205TmJHeHlXa1phVVZWVU1Eaz0" which seems nothing special so I will go over 
and explore filesystem and let this new string found here waiting for new hints?

Well I used as first "sudo -l" and found that we can do everything with sudo with no passwd..........ok.........

Inside /root found a 3rd.txt with the ingredient "fleeb juice" [2/3]

Now we need the last ingredient and my sixth sense tell me I need to "PE" on the webapp maybe cookie or something else, let's explore.

[long long long time after]

AAAAAAAAAH.....rabbit hole, neither the PHPSESSID or the string found on the response was the way to find the 3rd ingredient...actually
no PE was needed.

IDK why but all the other sections were just aesthetic thing or just a bait (or even both) so no PE on webapp was the right path.

Was really really really really more simple than that, in few words the second ingredient was in /home/rick.

Yeah I've created a complex idea on how to solve the machine where was simplier than that.....not so cool this time.

Btw we found all the 3 ingredient (last one was Jerry Tear) and pickle is returned back as human, we saved him!
