My firs exploit development through the cybermentor course "Pratical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course" (https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course).
The victim machine is vulnserver (https://thegreycorner.com/vulnserver.html) and the exploit is developmented with Immunity Debbuger (https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/) for check what register are filled (and what data are inside).
The type of exploit is a Buffer Overflow vulnerability.

What is BUFFER OVERFLOW?

The buffer space is where characters take place ---> in a buffer overflow attack you will continue to fill the buffer space until the maximum reach, than the EBP
and finally the EIP (the Return Address) and fill it with something that we need (like reverse shell)



How to CONDUCT OVERFLOW?

1) Spiking (find vulnerable part)
2) Fuzzing (send characters and see if you can break the vulnerable part)
3) find the Offset
4) overwrtie EIP
5) Find bad characters
6) Find the right module
7) Generate shellcode      (or malicious shell code)

_________
SPIKING

Ok, first thing to discovered is which command is vulnerable to overflow using simple .spk files
```
s_readline();
s_string("[COMMAND] ");
s_string_variable("0");
```
